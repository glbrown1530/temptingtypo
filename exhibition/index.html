        <h3><a href="https://artbase.rhizome.org/wiki/Q1992">Who is Flora?</a></h3>
        <p>by Travis Alber</p>
        <p>This net art work was inspired by the discovery of abandoned postcards chronicling the travels of a mysterious woman across 1940s America. The artist sought to breathe new life into these forgotten fragments of the past by translating them into an interactive digital narrative. However, due to the progress of the internet, the work's interactive elements and storytelling have now been lost to the digital ether.</p>

        <p>by Olia Lialina (1996)</p>
        <p>An early and influential work of net art, "My Boyfriend Came Back from the War" explores themes of isolation, communication, and the fragmentation of human relationships in the digital age.
