      <p>Welcome to "Fading Bytes: The Ephemeral Nature of Net Art," an online exhibition that explores the fragility and impermanence of our digital experiences through a curated selection of net art works. In a world where technological progress marches ever onward, even the most innovative and captivating digital artworks are not immune to the ravages of obsolescence.</p>
      <p>This exhibition honors the bittersweet reality that not all stories are destined to be preserved, and that the digital traces of our shared human experience can so easily fade into the ether. Through the works featured here, visitors will be invited to reflect on the fragility of our online existence and the importance of preserving the digital legacies that we create.</p>

        <h3>1. "Who is Flora?" by Travis Alber</h3>
        <img src="who-is-flora.jpg" alt="Screenshot of 'Who is Flora?'">
        <p>This net art work was inspired by the discovery of abandoned postcards chronicling the travels of a mysterious woman across 1940s America. The artist sought to breathe new life into these forgotten fragments of the past by translating them into an interactive digital narrative. However, due to the progress of the internet, the work's interactive elements and storytelling have now been lost to the digital ether.</p>

        <h3>2. "Brandon" (1998-1999) by Shu Lea Cheang</h3>
        <img src="brandon.jpg" alt="Screenshot of 'Brandon'">
        <p>"Brandon" is a net art work created by Taiwanese-American artist Shu Lea Cheang. The piece explores themes of identity, sexuality, and the blurring of boundaries between the online and offline worlds. The work is based on the true story of Brandon Teena, a transgender man who was murdered in 1993. Cheang's "Brandon" project used the internet as a platform to create an open-ended, collaborative narrative that evolved over time, inviting viewers to participate in the storytelling. The inclusion of "Brandon" in this exhibition would further highlight the fragility and impermanence of net art, as even works that have received institutional support have struggled to maintain their functionality and interactive elements over time.</p>

        <h3>3. "My Boyfriend Came Back from the War" by Olia Lialina (1996)</h3>
        <img src="my-boyfriend.jpg" alt="Screenshot of 'My Boyfriend Came Back from the War'">
        <p>An early and influential work of net art, "My Boyfriend Came Back from the War" explores themes of isolation, communication, and the fragmentation of human relationships in the digital age. The piece uses the unique capabilities of the web, such as nested frames and hyperlinks, to create a nonlinear, fragmented narrative that mirrors the isolation and communication challenges of the characters. This aligns well with the exhibition's focus on the fragility and impermanence of digital experiences. This work has also faced preservation challenges as web technologies have evolved, further underscoring the difficulties of maintaining the original "look and feel" of net art over time.</p>
