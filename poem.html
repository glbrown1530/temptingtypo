The faint breeze from the vastness of the river was just enough to rock the sailboats docked in its center, an odd foreground to the industrial backdrop, but nonetheless breathtaking at sunset. The occasional freight moved up and down its length caused the opening of the bridges, but in fact it was the small speed boats that would take off down the river from spot to spot that would cause the most wicked wakes. Yet even a singular heavy rain could disturb the entire balance and swell the river up over the banks and toward the singular roadway.
